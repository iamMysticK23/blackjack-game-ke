Blackjack JavaScript Game

This is a simple Blackjack game made with JavaScript.
I want to add more robust functionality to make it simulate a real blackjack experience.

I will revisit this code and add that functionality in the future.

For now the user can click on the Start Game button to generate two random "cards".
They can click the New Card button until they either hit Blackjack (21) or go over (bust).
The New Card button is disabled if the player gets a Blackjack or a bust.
If a player wants to play again after the round, they can hit Start Game again
